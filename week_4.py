#Programming Assignment 4.1 (added a function)

# A welcome message.
# A function with two parameters.
# A call to the function.
# The application should calculate the cost based upon the number of feet being ordered.
# A printed message displaying the company name and the total calculated cost.
# All costs should display in USD Currency Format Ex: $123.45.
# Your program must have a properly defined main method and a properly defined call to main
